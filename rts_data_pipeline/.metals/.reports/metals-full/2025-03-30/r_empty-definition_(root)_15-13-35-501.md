/* 
Ben, for maximum employability you’ll want your portfolio project to demonstrate an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that touches on multiple high-demand skills. In my experience, a project that shows you can ingest data via Kafka, process it in Spark Structured Streaming, and then store the cleaned and aggregated data in a modern, queryable format stands out.

Here’s what I’d recommend:

Build an End-to-End Pipeline:

Ingestion: Read data from Kafka using Spark Structured Streaming.
Transformation: Clean, parse, and aggregate the data using Scala’s functional transformations (which shows your proficiency in both functional programming and distributed processing).
Storage:
Option A: Write the processed data to a data lake using a columnar format like Parquet or, even better, Delta Lake if you want to highlight modern trends such as ACID transactions and time travel. Delta Lake is increasingly popular in industry (especially at organizations using Databricks) and demonstrates that you’re up to date with cutting-edge big data storage solutions.
Option B: Alternatively, you can use Spark’s JDBC support to load data into a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL). This shows that you can integrate with traditional SQL-based systems—a very common requirement in many companies.
Visualization/Dashboarding:

Even a simple BI dashboard (using tools like Apache Superset, Tableau, or a custom web app) that connects to your stored data can be a big plus. It shows that you understand how to make data actionable and accessible.
Why This Approach Is Your Best Bet:

End-to-End Exposure: You’ll demonstrate skills from data ingestion to storage and even visualization, covering the full spectrum of modern data engineering.
Modern Technologies: Delta Lake and Spark are highly sought after in the industry right now.
Flexibility: You can always mention that you’re also comfortable with more traditional systems like RDBMSs if needed, but showing proficiency with emerging technologies can set you apart.
Real-World Use Cases: Employers value candidates who can build robust, scalable pipelines that mimic production systems, and this project would do exactly that.
In summary, I’d lean toward building a pipeline that writes the cleaned data to a data lake using Delta Lake (or Parquet) and, if possible, also demonstrates how that data can be visualized. This option not only shows your real-time data processing skills but also your knowledge of modern data storage and analytics architectures—making you a very attractive candidate.

Let me know if you need further details on any part of the process or additional examples, Ben!

Here are a few ideas you might consider to showcase your data processing and enrichment skills in a portfolio project:

Time-Based Aggregations & Windowing:

Sliding/Fixed Window Averages: Calculate the average, min, and max of key readings (e.g., CO, NO₂, PM10) over 1‑minute, 5‑minute, or hourly windows. This shows your ability to do real‐time summarization.

Trend Analysis: Compute moving averages or rate-of-change to detect upward or downward trends in pollutant levels over time.

Geospatial Grouping & Enrichment:

Regional Summaries: Since you now have fixed sets of coordinates, group data by location (or by a “region” label you attach) to compute area-level statistics. For example, show the average air quality index by region over time.

Geo-Enrichment: You could enrich the data by mapping coordinates to city names or zones (e.g., “downtown,” “suburbs”). This might involve joining with a small static reference dataset.

Sensor Health & Reliability Metrics:

Error Rate Tracking: Monitor the frequency of ERROR statuses per sensor or per region. Flag sensors that consistently report errors.

Data Completeness: Track and report on missing or null values in readings to assess sensor performance.

Correlations Between Sensor Types:

Cross-Domain Analysis: If you have both air quality and weather sensors, join data on the same time and location to analyze how weather conditions (like temperature or wind speed) might affect pollutant levels.

Anomaly Detection: Identify time periods when the correlation between weather and air quality deviates significantly from the norm—these could be flagged as events or anomalies.

Event Detection & Alerting:

Threshold-Based Alerts: Build a stream processing task that triggers alerts when any reading exceeds a defined “danger” threshold (e.g., “DANGEROUS” status) or when there’s a sudden spike in pollutant levels.

Historical Context: Compare current readings with historical averages to decide if a sudden change is noteworthy.

Dashboard & Visualization Preparation:

Time Series Visualization: Aggregate data to create time series that can be fed into a dashboard (for example, using Grafana or Kibana). This demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from raw data to insight.

Heatmaps/Choropleths: Use your enriched geospatial data to build a heat map of air quality statuses or pollutant concentrations across your fixed sensor locations.

Data Cleaning & Normalization:

Handle Missing Data: Implement logic to deal with null values (e.g., imputing missing readings based on nearby data or flagging them).

Standardization: Normalize sensor readings (if needed) so that comparisons between different sensor types or devices are more meaningful.

Predictive Modeling (Optional Advanced Task):

Forecasting Sensor Readings: Use historical data to build a simple predictive model (e.g., using time series forecasting methods) that predicts air quality levels.

Impact Analysis: Determine which factors (like humidity, temperature, wind speed) most influence air quality readings.

How It Might End Up:

Your final project could have an architecture where raw sensor data flows through a stream processing engine (such as Apache Spark Streaming, Kafka Streams, or Flink). There, you perform windowed aggregations, join operations (for geo-enrichment and cross-sensor correlation), and error/anomaly detection. The processed data could then be stored in a database or sent directly to a visualization/dashboard tool. In your portfolio, you can present dashboards, code snippets for the data processing logic, and a brief explanation of the business insights or decisions that could be made from the analysis.

These tasks demonstrate not only your technical proficiency with streaming data and real-time processing but also your ability to transform raw sensor data into actionable insights—a highly valuable skill in many data engineering and data science roles.
